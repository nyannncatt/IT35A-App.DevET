*********** COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS **************





Overview-

According to (https://core.ac.uk/reader/11434179) The definition of a Web service can be exported to a definition file, published to a lookup service, and discovered by 
other software systems. These systems may hen nteract with the Web service in a manner described by its definition, using XML based messages conveyed by Internet protocols.
And according to (https://core.ac.uk/reader/336089) The specification presents the information set as a treeand accordingly the information items as the node of the tree. 
Any information item inthe XML document can be reached by recursively following the properties of the rootinformation item.

Purpose-

Web services- 
The most popular uses for web services are code reuse, service delivery, and linking pre-existing systems. Web services can also be used to integrate data between platforms. 
This can make any program completely interoperable since web services can be included into any application. An efficient method of modernizing an outdated application without 
having to start from scratch is to wrap it in a web service. This allows the application to become network-capable.

XML-
Flexibility, expressiveness, and usability of XML itself formed  an  interesting motive for researchers to shed more light on XML functionalities
and deployment either on commercial level or scientific level. As Web applications are timevulnerable, the increasing size of XML documents and the complexity of evaluating XML queries
pose new performance challenges to existing information retrievaltechnologies. The use of parallelism has shown good scalability in traditional database applications and provides an attractive 
solution to process structureddocuments [2]. A large number of XML documents can be distributed onto severalprocessing nodes so tha  a reasonable query response time can be achieved byprocessing
the related data in parallel.(https://core.ac.uk/reader/336089)

Web services use standardized protocols such as HTTP, SOAP, REST, and XML/JSON, making them easy to adopt across industries.
(Booth, D., Haas, H., & McCabe, F. (2004). "Web Services Architecture." W3C Working Group Note. Available at: https://www.w3.org/TR/ws-arch/)

Disadvantages of Web Services-

Performance Overhead
Web services (especially SOAP) introduce performance overhead due to XML processing, message parsing, and protocol complexity.
(Pautasso, C., Zimmermann, O., & Leymann, F. (2008). "RESTful Web Services vs. Big Web Services." WWW 2008 Proceedings. DOI: 10.1145/1367497.1367606).

Security Concerns
Web services rely on protocols like HTTPS and WS-Security, but security remains a challenge due to data transmission over public networks.
(Joshi, J. B. D., Bertino, E., Latif, U., & Ghafoor, A. (2001). "Access Control Language for Multi-domain Environments." IEEE Internet Computing. DOI: 10.1109/4236.968833).

Dependency on Internet Connection
Web services require an active network connection, making them unreliable in offline scenarios.
(Singh, A., & Juneja, D. (2013). "Security Concerns and Challenges in Web Services Communication." International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering).
